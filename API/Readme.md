# API Testing Project – Restful Booker Demo (Postman & Newman) – DEPI Group 201

Developed by Group 201 for the DEPI Software Testing Track.

This project validates core REST operations and authentication workflows on the public Restful Booker demo API using Postman collections and the Newman CLI.

---

## Project Overview

This project is an API testing collection targeting the **Restful Booker** demo application — a free REST API designed for practicing booking management scenarios (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

The team developed a Postman collection and environment to cover positive and negative test cases for authentication, booking management, and filtering features. The collection was then executed via Newman to produce a consolidated test report.

The main objectives of the project are to:

- Organize REST requests into a reusable, team-friendly Postman collection.
- Automate assertions for status codes and basic response structures using Postman test scripts (JavaScript with the pm API).
- Execute the full regression suite from the command line using Newman, generating a summary report with zero failures.
