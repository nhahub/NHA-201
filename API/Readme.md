\## Project Overview



This project is an API testing collection targeting the \*\*Restful Booker\*\* demo application, وهي REST API مجانية للتدريب على سيناريوهات الحجز (Create / Read / Update / Delete).  

The team created a Postman collection and environment to cover positive and negative scenarios for authentication, booking management, and filtering, then executed the collection via Newman to generate a consolidated test report.



The focus of the project is to:



\- Organize REST requests into a reusable, team‑friendly Postman collection.  

\- Automate assertion of status codes and basic response structure using Postman test scripts (JavaScript / pm API).  

\- Run the full regression suite from the command line using Newman, producing a summary report with zero failures.
